# Concordion Commands

A small set of Concordion Commands is provided below.

Readers should also look at the [Concordion Commands Specification](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/common/command/Command.html) and the [Concordion Expressions](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/common/command/expressions/Expressions.html).  


By default, Concordion deliberately restricts the expression format that is allowed.  However, [Complex Expressions](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/common/command/expressions/ComplexExpressions.html) can be achieved by applying the annotation @FullOGNL to your fixture class.
